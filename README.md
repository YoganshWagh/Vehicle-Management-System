# Vehicle-Management-System

I have designed my project “VEHICLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”. The Vehicle Management System In PHP is a simple mini project for managing the vehicles, buses & cars of RUET. In RUET there are many vehicles that can be hired for money. The project contains the admin side and the user side. The admin can control all the vehicle request and check if the request can be granted or not. They can update the driver and vehicle list, add new drivers, add new vehicles, etc. An admin can control the whole booking process from the admin panel like which car to give to a certain user and which driver to drive etc. As a whole, the admin has all the power to control the whole management process.

For the user side, a user can register & login their account to book a vehicle. He/she needs to login to book for a vehicle & there is an online application form. They can easily see all their transactions and the history of their traveling. They can see the bill in their account. These are all personalized. This project is a simple project that makes a convenient way for any traveler to make bookings.

 This project provides the facilities to the bank officials as they are very busy in their work; it is time consuming work for them to keep the things in manual registers. In the point of view my project saves a lot of time, which has important to that of money.
